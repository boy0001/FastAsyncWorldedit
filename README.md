# This is the legacy version of FAWE (1.8 - 1.12 and other platforms). It is no longer maintained. It may receive bug fixes, if even, but the focus lays on the newer versions of minecraft. You can find the new version [here](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/FastAsyncWorldEdit-1.13/).

FAWE is a fork of WorldEdit that has huge speed and memory improvements and considerably more features

It is available for Bukkit, Forge, Sponge and Nukkit.
